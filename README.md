# Hand Gesture Recognition for Hand Steerable Light System using Nvidia Jetson Nano

## Overview

This project aims to create a hand gesture recognition system using the Nvidia Jetson Nano platform to control a hand-steerable light system. The gesture recognition system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and recognize hand gestures, enabling users to interact with the light system in a natural and intuitive way.

The Nvidia Jetson Nano, with its powerful GPU and CUDA support, provides the necessary computational resources for real-time hand gesture recognition. The system captures live video from a camera module, processes the frames using deep learning models, and interprets recognized gestures to control the movement and intensity of the steerable lights.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition
- Multiple predefined gestures for light control
- Smooth and precise control of the hand-steerable light system
- Adjustable sensitivity and responsiveness
- Easy-to-use and intuitive interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Nvidia Jetson Nano Developer Kit
- USB Camera or CSI Camera Module
- Hand Steerable Light System (compatible with Jetson Nano GPIO)
- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your Jetson Nano:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saikk9834/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-for-Hand-Steerable-Light-System-using-Nvidia-Jetson-Nano.git
cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition-for-Hand-Steerable-Light-System-using-Nvidia-Jetson-Nano
```

2. Set up the virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Connect the USB/CSI camera module and the hand-steerable light system to the Nvidia Jetson Nano.

2. Run the main gesture recognition script:

```bash
python gesture_recognition.py
```

3. Point the camera towards your hand and perform the predefined gestures to control the light system.

4. Refer to the user manual for a list of supported gestures and their corresponding actions.

## Training Custom Gestures

The system comes pre-trained with a set of common hand gestures, but you may want to add custom gestures for specific functionalities. To train custom gestures, follow these steps:

1. Collect a dataset of images for each custom gesture. Ensure that the images are well-labeled with appropriate gesture names.

2. Use the dataset to train a new gesture recognition model. You can utilize popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

3. Once the model is trained, replace the existing model in the project with your custom-trained model.

4. Test the new gesture recognition system and fine-tune as needed.
